## Quasi Awesome Learning path
During my experience, I've collected a list of items to learn, revisit, and implement. My humble opinion is that this list should be in some sort of enough to have background/experience in software engineering, designing of a software, and in Computer Science in general.
Time to time, this list will grow. Will include videos to watch, articles to read, problem descriptions and their solutions (either from conferences, or from independent people). Each item from list, will have it's own summary after it's completion (of course if my time will permit to do so).
List will be mainly constructed for .Net and JS knowledge, just because my working proficiency is highly correlated with those two. But time after time, items will pop-up that do not have any connection with them, like AI, Python, and etc. Based on my knowledge of Russian language, some items will be in that language, sorry for inconvenience.
